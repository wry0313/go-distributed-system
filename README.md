# go-distributed-system

This is a miniature, Go-based distributed system that supports microservices architecture. It provides service registration, discovery, dependency updates, and a basic load balancing mechanism. You can integrate your own microservice by adding it to the cmd directory. This distributed system combines elements of both the hub-and-spoke model and the peer-to-peer model.
